      "\n",
      "* **3 slices of bread:** Assuming each slice is approximately 70 calories (this varies greatly depending on the type of bread – whole wheat, white, etc.), the total calorie intake from bread is 3 slices * 70 calories/slice = 210 calories.\n",
      "* **2 fried eggs:**  A large fried egg contains approximately 90 calories.  Therefore, 2 fried eggs contribute 2 * 90 calories/egg = 180 calories.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Total calorie intake from breakfast:** 210 calories (bread) + 180 calories (eggs) = 390 calories.\n",

      "**2. BMI Calculation:**\n",
      "\n",
      "First, we need to convert your height to metric units:\n",
      "\n",
      "* 1 foot = 0.3048 meters\n",
      "* 5.8 feet = 5.8 feet * 0.3048 meters/foot ≈ 1.77 meters\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, we can calculate your Body Mass Index (BMI):\n",
      "\n",

      "* BMI = 80 kg / (1.77 m)^2 ≈ 25.5 kg/m²\n",

      "* **Breakfast (already consumed - 390 calories):**  Consider swapping white bread for whole-wheat to increase fiber and reduce calorie density.  Add fruits or vegetables to increase nutrient intake.\n",
      "* **Lunch (approx. 600-700 calories):**  A large salad with grilled chicken or fish, a whole-wheat wrap with lean protein and vegetables, or a lentil soup with whole-grain bread.\n",
      "* **Dinner (approx. 600-700 calories):**  Baked salmon with steamed vegetables, chicken stir-fry with brown rice, or a vegetarian chili with whole-grain crackers.\n",
      "* **Snacks (approx. 200-300 calories):**  Fruits (apple, banana, berries), vegetables (carrots, celery), a small handful of nuts, Greek yogurt.\n",

      "**Important Considerations:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Hydration:** Drink plenty of water throughout the day.\n",

      "\n",
      "Since you're overweight, a calorie deficit is crucial for weight loss.  A safe and sustainable weight loss is typically 0.5-1 kg (1-2 pounds) per week.  This requires a daily calorie deficit of approximately 500-1000 calories.  However, I cannot provide a specific plan without knowing your activity level and complete dietary intake for a typical day.\n",

      "\n",
      "* **Balanced Macronutrients:** Aim for a balanced intake of protein, carbohydrates, and healthy fats.\n",
      "    * **Protein:**  Essential for satiety and muscle maintenance.  Good sources include lean meats, poultry, fish, beans, lentils, and tofu.\n",
      "    * **Carbohydrates:** Choose complex carbohydrates like whole grains, fruits, and vegetables over refined carbohydrates like white bread and sugary drinks.\n",
      "    * **Healthy Fats:**  Include sources like avocados, nuts, seeds, and olive oil.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Hydration:** Drink plenty of water throughout the day.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Regular Physical Activity:** Incorporate at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise per week, along with strength training exercises twice a week.\n",
      "\n",
