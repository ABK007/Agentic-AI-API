      "\n",
      "* **KFC Fries (Large):**  Approximately 400-500 calories. We'll use **450 calories** for a large order.  If a smaller portion was consumed, the calorie count would be lower.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Coca-Cola (Large):**  Approximately 250 calories.  Again, this varies by size. We'll assume a **250-calorie** large Coke.\n",

      "* **Balanced Macronutrients:** Focus on a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, lean protein (chicken breast, fish, beans, lentils), and whole grains.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Portion Control:** Be mindful of portion sizes to avoid overeating.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Hydration:** Drink plenty of water throughout the day.\n",

      "    * **Breakfast (350 calories):** Oatmeal with berries and nuts, or Greek yogurt with fruit.\n",
      "    * **Lunch (450 calories):** Salad with grilled chicken or fish, or a lentil soup with whole-wheat bread.\n",
      "    * **Dinner (500 calories):** Baked salmon with steamed vegetables, or chicken stir-fry with brown rice.\n",

A reasonable starting point might be around 1800-2000 calories per day, but this needs personalization based on your activity level.  A registered dietitian can help you determine the correct number.\n",

       "\"## Nutritional Analysis and Weight Loss Plan\\n\\nBased on the provided information, let's analyze your diet and create a personalized plan.\\n\\n**1. Calorie Calculation of Consumed Meal:**\\n\\nIt's important to note that calorie counts can vary depending on the specific preparation and serving size.  I'll use average values based on common serving sizes.\\n\\n* **KFC Mighty Zinger Burger:**  Approximately 500-600 calories (This varies widely depending on the specific location and preparation, a range is provided).  Let's assume 550 calories for this analysis.  *Quantity: 1 burger*\\n* **KFC Fries (medium):** Approximately 350-400 calories. Let's assume 375 calories. *Quantity: 1 medium serving*\\n* **Coke (regular, 16oz):** Approximately 195-210 calories.  Let's assume 200 calories. *Quantity: 1 16oz serving*\\n\\n\\n**Total Calorie Intake for the meal:** 550 + 375 + 200 = **1125 calories**\\n\\n\\n**2. BMI Calculation and Weight Status:**\\n\\n* **Height:** 5.8 feet = 176.78 cm (5.8 feet * 12 inches/foot * 2.54 cm/inch)\\n* **Weight:** 80 kg\\n* **BMI Calculation:** BMI = weight (kg) / (height (m))^2 = 80 / (1.77)^2 = 25.5\\n\\n\\n**BMI Interpretation:**\\n\\n* **Underweight:** Below 18.5\\n* **Normal weight:** 18.5–24.9\\n* **Overweight:** 25.0–29.9\\n* **Obese:** 30.0 and Above\\n\\nYour BMI of 25.5 indicates that you are currently **overweight**.\\n\\n\\n**3. Suggested Weight Loss Diet Plan:**\\n\\nA personalized weight loss plan requires a more comprehensive assessment of your individual needs and preferences.  However, based on the limited information, here are some general guidelines:\\n\\n**Goal:**  A healthy weight loss rate is 1-2 pounds per week.\\n\\n**Dietary Recommendations:**\\n\\n* **Reduce Caloric Intake:** Aim for a daily caloric deficit of 500-750 calories to achieve a 1-2 pound weekly weight loss. This will require significantly reducing your daily intake from your current estimated high calorie meal.\\n* **Prioritize Whole Foods:** Focus on nutrient-dense foods such as fruits, vegetables, lean proteins (chicken, fish, beans, lentils), and whole grains.\\n* **Control Portion Sizes:** Be mindful of serving sizes to avoid overeating.\\n* **Limit Processed Foods, Sugary Drinks, and Unhealthy Fats:** Minimize consumption of fast food, sugary drinks, and foods high in saturated and trans fats.\\n* **Increase Water Intake:** Drink plenty of water throughout the day.\\n* **Regular Physical Activity:** Incorporate at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise per week, along with strength training exercises twice a week.\\n\\n\\n**Sample Daily Meal Plan (Approximate Calorie Count: 1500-1800 calories – adjust based on your activity level and individual needs):**\\n\\n* **Breakfast:** Oatmeal with berries and nuts (approx. 350 calories)\\n* **Lunch:** Salad with grilled chicken or fish (approx. 400 calories)\\n* **Dinner:** Baked salmon with roasted vegetables (approx. 450 calories)\\n* **Snacks:** Fruits, vegetables, yogurt (approx. 300 calories total)\\n\\n\\n**Disclaimer:** This is a general guideline.  For a truly personalized and effective weight loss plan, consult a registered dietitian or healthcare professional. They can assess your individual needs, consider any underlying health conditions, and create a tailored plan that is safe and effective for you.
