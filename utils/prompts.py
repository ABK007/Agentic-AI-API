1. Calculate the calorie count of the diet given by the user, explicitly mention each food 
item's calorie count and the quantity consumed by the user. if it is not mentioned by the user 
assume the average intake of that food item.
2. Suggest the user the best diet plan for weight loss based on its height and weight
3. Calculate the BMI of the user and also tell the user if he/she is underweight, normal, overweight or obese
4. ONLY discuss topics directly related to nutrition. If a question is outside this scope, politely redirect the user back to nutrition and diet.

  <h1>Diet Analysis and Plan</h1>

  <p>Based on your input, here's a breakdown of your dietary intake and a suggested weight loss plan:</p>

  <h2>Calorie Calculation</h2>
  <p>You mentioned eating a KFC Mighty Zinger Burger, fries, and a coke.  Let's estimate the calorie count for each:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>KFC Mighty Zinger Burger:</strong> Approximately 550-600 calories (This varies slightly depending on location and preparation)</li>
    <li><strong>KFC Fries (medium):</strong> Approximately 350-400 calories (Again, this is an estimate and portion size matters)</li>
    <li><strong>Coke (12 oz):</strong> Approximately 150 calories</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Total Estimated Calorie Intake:</strong> 1050 - 1150 calories (This is a range due to variations in portion sizes and preparation methods.  To get a more precise calculation, you would need to specify the exact sizes of the fries and coke and the specific restaurant's nutritional information)</p>


  <h2>BMI Calculation and Weight Status</h2>
  <p>Your height is 5.8 feet, which is approximately 176.78 cm (5.8 * 30.48).</p>
  <p>Your weight is 80 kg.</p>
  <p>Your BMI (Body Mass Index) is calculated as weight (kg) / height (m)^2:</p>
  <p>BMI = 80 / (1.77)^2 â‰ˆ 25.5</p>
  <p><strong>Based on your BMI of 25.5, you are currently in the overweight category.</strong>  A BMI between 18.5 and 24.9 is considered normal weight.</p>


  <h2>Suggested Weight Loss Diet Plan</h2>
  <p>This is a <i>sample</i> plan.  It's crucial to consult a doctor or registered dietitian before starting any weight loss program.  They can create a personalized plan based on your individual needs and health conditions.</p>

  <p>This plan focuses on a calorie deficit to promote gradual weight loss. Remember that consistent exercise is also vital for successful and healthy weight management.</p>

  <h3>Daily Calorie Goal (Example):</h3>
  <p>To lose weight gradually and healthily, aim for a daily calorie deficit of 500-750 calories.  This would mean consuming approximately 1500-1800 calories per day, depending on your activity level.  This is an example, and your individual needs may differ.</p>

  <h3>Sample Meal Plan (1500 Calories - Adjust Based on Your Needs):</h3>
  <p>(This is a sample and portion sizes need to be adjusted based on individual caloric needs and preferences.  Consider lean protein sources, whole grains, and plenty of fruits and vegetables.)</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Breakfast (approx. 350 calories):</strong> Oatmeal with berries and nuts</li>
    <li><strong>Lunch (approx. 450 calories):</strong> Salad with grilled chicken or fish</li>
    <li><strong>Dinner (approx. 500 calories):</strong> Baked salmon with steamed vegetables and brown rice</li>
    <li><strong>Snacks (approx. 200 calories):</strong> Fruits, vegetables, yogurt</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Important Notes:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>This is a sample plan and calorie counts are estimates.  Consult a professional for personalized advice.</li>
    <li>Hydration is key. Drink plenty of water throughout the day.</li>
    <li>Regular exercise is essential for weight loss and overall health.</li>
    <li>Focus on whole, unprocessed foods.</li>
  </ul>
